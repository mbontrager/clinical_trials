I'd rather query clinicaltrials.gov directly and parse the results myself. So to get started doing that, I did a little exploration of clinicaltrials.gov. It's not the easist website in the world to pull data from, but it's also relatively painless and I can get back a lot of data. XML output for clinical trials searches can be downloaded directly by adding the `resultsxml=true` flag to a search URL. So for example, I searched with the following terms:\n\n> https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/results?term=cancer+OR+tumor+OR+tumour+OR+leukemia&recr=Open&type=Intr&locn=United+States\n\nwhich as of today returns ~6018 open, intervential clinical trials in the U.S. with the terms \"Cancer\" or \"tumor\"... etc. To pull a zipped xml output of all of those trials I can just pass:\n\n> https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/results?term=cancer+OR+tumor+OR+tumour+OR+leukemia&recr=Open&type=Intr&locn=United+States&resultsxml=true\n\nand that should initiate a zip file download which, when unzipped, contains one XML file per clinical trial. \n\n```{r}\nz <- clinicaltrials_search(query = 'breast+cancer')\nstr(z)\nclinicaltrials_count(query = c(\"type=Intr\", \"cond=cancer\", \"recr=Open\", \"locn=United States\"))\ny <- clinicaltrials_download(query = c(\"type=Intr\", \"cond=cancer\", \"recr=Open\", \"locn=United States\"), \n                             count = 10, \n                             include_results = TRUE)\n```\n\n",
